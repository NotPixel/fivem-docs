At NotPixel, we offer various ways of living in the wonderful city of Los Santos.
You can opt-in to purchasing a motel as your starter place, or you can go all out and purchase a house.

## Motels

You can find a motel almost anywhere on the map. There are around 5-10 motels to rent out.
Keep in mind, you can only rent one motel.

You will have to check every 7 days if your payment is due. Failure to pay after the 7 days will result in a revoke of Motel.
Everything within will be lost, so make sure you are active and able to pay for the Motel.

You can purchase a Motel by going to any one of the motels on the map, and you should see
3D text to press [E] to rent. Upon doing so, you will be given the keys and a motel ID.

You will get access to a stash and wardrobe, where you can access your clothing store outfits.

## Housing

One of the greatest things that NotPixel offers is housing. We have officially taken it to the next level.

You can purchase a house from a realtor, able to find in-game through Yellow Pages, Twitter, Legion Square,
word-of-mouth. The Realtor will ask you a series of questions and you can come up with a deal.

The ability to Finance a house is an option. But in order to do this, you must prove a stable income.

Upon purchasing a house, you will be given an interior based upon the outside of the house.
You will be able to completely customize the interior of the house. 

Your "Control Panel" will be at the Exit of the door. From here, you can set the stash location,
wardrobe location, give keys, and you can access the Furniture UI.

Keep in mind, each piece of Furniture costs money.
