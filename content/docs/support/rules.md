Welcome to the new, fresh rules page. We have migrated from Google Docs because it's more accessible through here.
These rules are crucial in ensuring a fair and realistic Roleplay experience.

We hope the rules listed outline everything but please keep in mind that rules are subject to change without notice.
If you have any questions or queries, feel free to contact a staff member through the [discord](https://discord.notpixel.com).
