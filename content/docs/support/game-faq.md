Everything looks very blurry, how do I fix this?
-------------------------------------

This is due to issues with having Texture Quality on anything above Normal.
To fix this, please go to your GTA V Settings > Video Settings > Texture Quality > **Normal**

You should then restart your game and no longer have Texture loss.

How do I clear my cache?
------------------------

To clear your cache, please do the following:
- Close FiveM, also double check Task Manager.
- Right click your FiveM Shortcut and click `open file location`
- Double Click **FiveM Application Data** and open the Cache folder.
- Delete all files in there, **excluding** the `game` folder.
- Launch FiveM and connect to `notpixel.com`.

Do we have an AOP?
-------------------------

At NotPixel, we feel as though an AOP restricts Roleplay. 
Therefore, we do not have a set AOP, and RP can be anywhere on the map.

Why did I randomly die and what can I do about it?
-------------------------

If this happened to you, first attempt to capture a recording of you magically dying.
Unfortunately, if you can't get a recording, there is nothing we can do about it.

Once you've obtained the recording, please head to #tech-support on Discord and explain what happened.

A staff member will review the recording and will either revive you on the spot or compensate at a later time.

Where are the keybinds located for the server?
-------------------------

You can find the Keybinds [here](/docs/getting-started/hotkeys)
