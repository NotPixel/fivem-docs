If you are faced with a situation that contains a violation of one or more rules, you should contact a staff member.
There is a certain procedure which you must follow before contacting a staff member.

Please do your best to record the situation and press F10 to obtain the player ID and name.

Once you have gathered enough evidence to create a report, please create a ticket in the [discord](https://discord.notpixel.com).
A staff member will then review the situation and provide a reply.

Under urgent circumstances, please directly message a staff member using the chain of command.

**Keep in mind**

1. Staff are not always available 24/7
2. Do not create an argument through Discord or in-game
3. You should never directly message a staff member unless urgent.
4. Please do not make accusations when reporting other players.
5. Try to remain during the process.
