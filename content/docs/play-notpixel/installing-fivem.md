Installing FiveM is pretty straightforward. It's usually a matter of [downloading FiveM][fivem], then simply running the
downloaded file. For those who'd like a bit more detail, read below.

Installing FiveM
----------

- [Download FiveM][fivem] off the website.
- Run FiveM.exe. If you run the installer in an empty folder, FiveM will install there. Otherwise, it will install
  in `%localappdata%\FiveM`.
- Start FiveM from your Windows start menu.

Installing TeamSpeak
----------

Due to our dependency on Teamspeak as our Voice-Over IP Protocal, we depend on the TokoVOIP plugin.
A short list of features that TokoVOIP offers:

- Proximity-based audio
- Directional audio
- Radio system
- Phone calls
- Radio effects
- Radio clicks
